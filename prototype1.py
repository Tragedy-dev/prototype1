    #   * Set a variable to a Boolean that represents if the code thinks the laser sensor should be interrupted.
    #   * if the sensor is interrupted and the code has not acknowledged it yet --> save interrupt and change the boolean to true
    #   * if the sensor is no longer interrupted and the code has not acknowledged the change --> save the end of the interrupt and change the the boolean to false
    #   * this allows a toggle of each detection so the program does not get bound on only one of the interrupts.
